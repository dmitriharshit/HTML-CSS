    <h1>Chickens</h1>
    <p><b>Chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as
        the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are
        originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated
        is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <p>Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
        Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now
        keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion in
        2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to
        chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in
        language and literature.</p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[11][12

        Other terms are:

        Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[13][14]
        Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
        Chick: a young chicken[15]
        Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
        Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17]
        Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18]
        Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
        immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20]
        Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21]
        Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as
        a species were typically referred to as common
        fowl or domestic fowl.[22][page needed][failed verification]

        Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or late 18th century
        as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation
        of the original English cock,[24][25][26] and is widely used throughout North America. Roosting is the action of
        perching aloft to sleep at night</p>
